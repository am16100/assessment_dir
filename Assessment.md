This is Python code written to allow conversion of a DNA sequence into a protein sequence. 
The code will also design primers for PopinF vector and produce a molecular weight of the correct protein. 
In this case the sample data is the DNA sequence for AT2, a protein from the mupirocin biosyhtnetic gene cluster,
and has already been input into the code as coding_DNA.
 
1. Save both the MW.py file and the Assessment_Code.py file in the same working directory.

2. Open the Assessment_Code.py file and input desired DNA sequence into the coding_DNA line 
(example data has already been pasted in.

3. Save the file and then run -- python Assessment_Code.py in the terminal

4. The output should have the format:
Forward primer sequence:
Reverse primer sequence:
GC difference: (pass or fail)
Protein sequence:
MW =
